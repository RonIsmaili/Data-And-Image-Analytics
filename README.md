My first assignment of the course was a team project (me, Manuel and Alberto), the aim of this assignment was to create a classifier which should accurately determine the gender of an individual based on their full name. Our classifier got a final score (accuracy) of 90%.

My second assignment was also a team project (me and Alberto), the aim of this assignment was to create a classifier which should accurately determine if an individual would survive the tragedy of the titanic, based on data such as their name, gender, cabin number, safety boats, etc. Our classifier got a final accuracy of 94% (best of the 3 different algorithms we utilized).

My third assignment was an individual project, for this project we were instructed to utilize all of the knowledge that we obtained during the course of the semester, and experiment with different approaches. We were given multiple datasets out of which I chose 3 (Student marks, wine quality and student data) to work on and experiment with. I also performed "Data Analysis" on the data with the knowledge that I had gained. In the end I got varying results for the algorithms. <br>
For the student marks dataset I had a final accuracy of 99%, for the wine quality dataset I had a final accuracy of 36% and for the student data dataset a final accuracy of 16%.

Although I did not obtain perfect accuracies, I learned a **lot** from these projects.
